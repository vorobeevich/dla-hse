# Homework 2 (KWS)

This is the second homework in the DLA course dedicated to the KWS problem. The task description is in **task_description.md**, and my report is in **report.md**. You can start the main.ipynb notebook to check if the solution works. All libraries are installed in the notebook, you can open it in google collab (the code will work even on cpu).
